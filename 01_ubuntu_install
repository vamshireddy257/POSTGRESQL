Try connecting through putty.
Get IP by 
ip a
or 
ip addr

you will not be able to connect through ssh(putty,mobaxterm etc....)

SO do 
sudo su - 

apt update -y
apt upgrade -y 
apt install openssh-server -y 
service ssh status 
#also install vim as vi doesnt work as expected
apt install vim -y

Now connection should establish from putty.
Note: You can't directly connect to root.

so 
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
FROM:
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
TO:
PermitRootLogin yes
sudo systemctl restart ssh

sudo su - (login to root)
change password 
passwd 

now you can login directly with root user.
